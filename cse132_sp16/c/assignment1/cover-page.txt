## Assignment Questions

1. Solve the following bitwise and boolean operations, assuming they are written in C and the numbers are `int`s.

	a. 0 || 23 == 1
	b. 0 | 23 == 10111 == 23
	c. 5 && 0 == 0
	d. 5 & 3 == 001 == 1
	e. !4 == 0
	f. ~5 == -6
	g. 7 >> 3 == 0
	h. 3 ^ 5 == 110 == 6

 -2^23
3. Explain in a couple of sentences the advantages of breaking your program into multiple files and using header files to declare functions.
It allows you to compile each source file individually, without actually including any other sources.
4. What is `make`'s implicit rule for compiling `.c` files into `.o` files?
'n.o' is made automatically from 'n.c' with a command of the form '$(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)'.
